=========================================
Displaying graphs in terminal using ASCII
=========================================

.. currentmodule:: backend_ascii

Description::
=============
Using this module enables the user to have a 2D function's graph-plot displayed in ASCII format in the terminal.


Usage::
=======  
 To use this backend, add the module ``backend_ascii`` to the local ``PYTHONPATH`` and set the backend ``rcparameter`` to ``module://backend_ascii``

Once the backend is set to backend_ascii, using the ``show()`` method will result in outputting the plot graph to the terminal using ASCII characters
   

Note::
======
In the current version, this backend does not support drwaing anything else but the graph. Therefore, when showing the figure it is recommended to turn off the axes display using ``matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')``
