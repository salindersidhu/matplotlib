Implemented a new drawing feature using the mouse cursor
=========================================================

Matplotlib now supports the ability for users to draw on the graph canvas.
Using the mouse, select the Draw paintbrush icon from the toolbar. Then 
click and drag on any part of the graph or canvas to free-hand draw. 
When the tool is deselected, the drawing remains on the canvas.
